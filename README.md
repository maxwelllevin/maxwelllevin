### Hey 👋🏻, I'm Max

I write software to support renewable energy development and climate research [@pnnl.gov](https://www.pnnl.gov), [@arm.gov](https://www.arm.gov), and [@a2e.gov](https://a2e.energy.gov).

- 🛠 I’m currently working on:
  * ♻️ [@tsdat](https://www.github.com/tsdat), a python library used to standardize data for renewable energy projects <!-- [@a2e.gov](https://a2e.energy.gov) and [@pnnl.gov](https://www.pnnl.gov) -->
  * 🔬 a few [@arm.gov](https://www.arm.gov) data products: [thermocldphase](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/thermocloudphase), [ccnkappa](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/ccnsmpskappa), [acsmcdce](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/acsmcdce), [mergedsmpsaps](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/mergedsmpsaps)
  * 📈 metrics to understand [@arm.gov](https://www.arm.gov)'s impact in climate research
- ⏳ In my spare time I follow the Premiere League (go [@LFC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com)!), solve chess puzzles, and make cookies
